        <p>Worcester Source is looking for sponsorship to pay for the ongoing costs of hosting the meets, which at present are covered out of the organiser’s own pockets.</p>

        <p>We have free use of the current venue on the basis that attendees buy their own drinks, but as most participants come directly from work, we also provide food. There are also ongoing costs associated with having a presence on meetup.com, which is crucial for the management of upcoming events, and as a means of attracting new members.</p>

        <p>We’re looking for between £30-60 per meet to cover these costs, with a minimum sponsorship of four meets. In exchange for which you’ll receive an entry on the sponsorship page on meetup.com, a public thank you at the start of the meet you’ve sponsored, and a further thank you on the slack channel the following day.</p>

        <p>If you’re interested in more direct access to the members, such as time at the start of the meet to promote your services, we’re happy to negotiate something.</p>

        <p>If you think you can help, <a href="mailto:daniel&#64;limeblast.co.uk">please get in touch</a>.</p>
